# skeatwareAntiFlood
This is a antiflood for blooket I used https://github.com/Blooketware/BlooketUI/tree/main menu for a gui (I dont know much about creating gui's in java)
You need to click the antiflood.js file and copy the contents and make it a bookmark. Make sure you click in when you've created the lobby. Enjoy my antiflood!
